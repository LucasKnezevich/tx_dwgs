# Standards
## Technology Stack
### MySQL
The database used will be MySQL because it is open-source, provides good integration with the stack, and is well documented. 

### Express.js
Express will be used for routing traffic and API functions. This reduces the number of programming languages used in this project. 

### React.js
React will power the front-end and was chosen because it provides a fast and elegant way of managing content and quickly updating based on user interaction. 

### Python
Some data wrangling and complex analysis will be done using Python because of the excellent analysis libraries available. Integrating this functionality with Javascript stack may prove challenging. 

## Documentation
The project will be documented using Sphinx and the plugin that supports adding Markdown pages. Overview information will be added and updated to the readme file, but the code, information about the API, and all other documentation will be added to the Sphinx pages.

## GitHub
The GitHub will serve as the code repository the project, and updates to the main branch will follow the standard approval process. Feature branches will add additional functionality and features, and with review and approval, will be merged to main.
